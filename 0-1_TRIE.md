# 0 - 1 TRIE

Prerequisites: TRIE data structure

# Problem
Given $n$ numbers, maximize $a$ xor $b$, where $a,b$ are elements in the list.

Time complexity: $O(n\log(n))$

Sol:

Use a 0 - 1 Trie to store each number.

For each number, extract its binary digits. From MSD to LSD choose greedily such that each digit is 1. 

E.g

If the number is $13 = 1101_2$, we should aim for a number like $1110010_2$.

So at every moment, if we can choose a number such that the current digit xor's to become 1, then we should choose it

Why? because this digit has more influence than all digits below it. if this is equal to 0, it doesnt matter if everything else is 1. it is still less than if it is 1.
